# Choosing a Distro:
While choosing a Linux distro, you may be overwhelmed by the sheer number of options out there. But realistically, you only need to care about four major base distros: Arch, Debian, Fedora, and openSUSE.
Almost everything else originates from these. There are other unique ones too, but you’ll discover them naturally as you go deeper down the Linux rabbit hole.

## **Things not to do while choosing a distro:**

1. **Choose a distro based on looks:**
Don’t pick a distro just because it looks pretty. Customization is one of Linux’s biggest strengths, with a few tweaks, you can make any distro look like another. Choose based on functionality, not form.

2. **Choose a niche distro with no community support:**
Avoid distros that have little to no community. When something breaks (and it will at some point), the community is where you’ll go for help, guides, and fixes.

3. **Choose a “hacking distro”:**
Distros like Kali or Parrot OS aren’t meant for daily use, even their developers say so. They’re designed for quick testing and security research in a virtual machine. With a huge number of preinstalled tools comes a huge attack surface. And please, don’t install Kali just because you saw it in "Mr. Robot."

4. **Choose something you don’t understand:**
Just don’t jump into Arch just because you heard it’s popular. If you’re willing to read the wiki and learn as you go, Arch can be a great experience. But if you’re not ready to troubleshoot or spend time setting things up, it’ll quickly become annoying and more trouble than it’s worth.

5. **Distro hop:**
There’s nothing wrong with trying different distros, but if you’re just hopping around to “find one for you” without knowing what you actually need, you’ll just waste time jumping from one to another.

## Recommended Linux Distributions:
Here are some of my recommended distros from each major distribution for beginners using ASUS TUF laptops (keep in mind the numbers aren’t a ranking, just a simple list )

1. Fedora:

If you are trying Linux for the first time, I would highly recommend Fedora. It’s a semi-rolling release distro (the kernel and most packages are updated regularly but it still follows a release cycle). It also has excellent software support and compatibility.

2. EndeavourOS:

EndeavourOS is basically Arch Linux with a GUI installer. It’s a great distro if you want to try Arch for the first time. If you’re willing to read the documentation, it’s an excellent great.

3. Linux Mint:

ASUS software compatibility is limited on Debian-based distros, so for that reason, I generally recommend other distros. That said, Mint is still possibly the best beginner-friendly Debian-based distro in my opinion.

4. openSUSE Tumbleweed:

Tumbleweed is a rolling release distro similar to Arch, but updates are slightly slower since they are thoroughly tested. This makes it more stable in my experience. It also has a GUI for almost everything using YaST, so you can configure and manage most tasks without touching the terminal.
