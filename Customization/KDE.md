On KDE, the easiest way to install themes, widgets, cursors, and more is through Discover or directly from System Settings.

# Discover:
Discover is KDE’s default application store. If it is not installed, you can install it by installing the `discover` package. It allows you to download applications and themes for system components such as cursors, icons, the login manager (SDDM), and more.

{% hint style="info" %}
Global themes download all required icons and cursors at once to match the desktop shown in the preview image, whereas other options download individual items.
{% endhint %}

To download and use a theme, download it from the relevant tab. Once downloaded, open System Settings > Global Themes, navigate to the appropriate content category, and apply the theme.

# Settings:
Open System Settings and go to the Global Themes section. Navigate to the content category you want to customize, then click <kbd>Get New</kbd> in the top-right corner. This will open a new window where you can browse and install available content.

Once the content is downloaded, you can apply it directly from the `“Get New”` window. After installation, the <kbd>Apply</kbd> button will appear next to it. Alternatively, you can close the window and apply the content from the `Global Themes` tab. Simply select the downloaded item and click <kbd>Apply</kbd>.
