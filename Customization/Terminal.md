# Fonts:
Fonts are what change how text looks. Start by downloading a font of your choice from [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/), and also download the “Symbols Nerd Font” because it is required by fastfetch and some other apps to display icons. Once you have both fonts, install them on your system.

After installing the fonts, you only need to enable the main Nerd Font you downloaded in your terminal, like Meslo, Fira Code, or any other Nerd Font you chose. You do not need to enable the Nerd Symbols font separately, as it will be used automatically. Depending on the terminal you use, you may need to edit the terminal configuration file or enable the font through the terminal settings in the GUI.
