# Introduction:
The idea behind this guide is to simplify the process of running Linux on ASUS TUF laptops. While it isn’t perfect, it covers most of the steps you’d normally do on other operating systems too. The main goal is to help newcomers get comfortable with Linux without running into too many problems.

This guide includes general tips and advice from my Linux experience, so you don’t waste time on random trial-and-error. It may look long, but it’s just detailed, following it will help you avoid getting stuck and make sure you do things the right way.

It’s not perfect and may have some flaws, but I’ve tried to cover everything important.

The guide assumes you’re using either KDE or GNOME with GRUB, so 
some packages or commands might differ depending on your distro.


## Choosing a Distro:
While choosing a Linux distro, you may be overwhelmed by the sheer number of options out there. But realistically, you only need to care about four major base distros: Arch, Debian, Fedora, and openSUSE.
Almost everything else originates from these. There are other unique ones too, but you’ll discover them naturally as you go deeper down the Linux rabbit hole.

## **Things not to do while choosing a distro:**

1. **Choose a distro based on looks:**
Don’t pick a distro just because it looks pretty. Customization is one of Linux’s biggest strengths, with a few tweaks, you can make any distro look like another. Choose based on functionality, not form.

2. **Choose a niche distro with no community support:**
Avoid distros that have little to no community. When something breaks (and it will at some point), the community is where you’ll go for help, guides, and fixes.

3. **Choose a “hacking distro”:**
Distros like Kali or Parrot OS aren’t meant for daily use, even their developers say so. They’re designed for quick testing and security research in a virtual machine. With a huge number of preinstalled tools comes a huge attack surface. And please, don’t install Kali just because you saw it in "Mr. Robot."

4. **Choose something you don’t understand:**
Just don’t jump into Arch just because you heard it’s popular. If you’re willing to read the wiki and learn as you go, Arch can be a great experience. But if you’re not ready to troubleshoot or spend time setting things up, it’ll quickly become annoying and more trouble than it’s worth.

5. **Distro hop:**
There’s nothing wrong with trying different distros, but if you’re just hopping around to “find one for you” without knowing what you actually need, you’ll just waste time jumping from one to another.

## Does and donts while using to linux:
### Does
1. Ask for help in your distro’s community.
If you run into issues, don’t hesitate to ask. Most communities are very helpful as long as you provide relevant details about your problem. Avoid vague questions like “How do I fix this?” without context.

2. Use the terminal.
The terminal may look intimidating at first, but it’s not that complicated. It lets you perform tasks more efficiently than GUI tools. You don’t need to memorize everything, commands will become familiar as you use them.

3. Read the documentation.
If you’re unsure how to install or configure a package, check your distro’s official wiki first. If it’s not there, the Arch Wiki often has excellent, detailed explanations for many Linux topics.

4. Have a backup.
System crashes or broken configurations can happen on any OS, including Linux. Regular backups ensure you can restore your system to a previous working state without losing important files.

5. Keep your system updated.
Updates fix bugs, improve performance, and patch security vulnerabilities.

## Do's and Don'ts While Using Linux
### Do's:

1. Ask for help in your distro’s community.
Provide relevant details about your issue communities are helpful if you’re cooperative and clear.

2. Use the terminal.
It’s not as complicated as it seems and often lets you work more efficiently. You’ll learn commands as you go.

3. Read the documentation.
Check your distro’s wiki for guidance. If not available, the Arch Wiki often has detailed explanations.

4. Have a backup.
Linux systems can break just like any OS,keep backups to restore when needed.

5. Keep your system updated.
Regular updates prevent bugs and security issues.


### Don'ts:
1.Don’t expect it to be Windows.
Linux isn’t Windows, so don’t try to compare it in every aspect. Learn to use it on its own terms.

2.Don’t blindly copy commands.
Running random commands without understanding what they do can break your system or worse, install malware. While malware on Linux is rare, it does exist.

3.Don’t panic when things break.
Things will break sometimes. Panicking won’t help. If you have a backup, you can restore your system to the previous working state.

4.Don’t ignore updates.
Skipping updates can leave your system vulnerable to bugs and security issues. Regularly update your system and installed applications
